comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. There may be enough evidence to support annotation to a more specific term such as 'abnormal transcriptional response to pheromone' (FYPO:0000984); if not, it is safer to annotate to 'increased transcription' (FYPO:0000780) or 'decreased transcription' (FYPO:0000781) rather than explicitly claiming that an effect on regulation was observed.

comment: Note that trace amounts of another carbon source are usually required for S. pombe growth on glycerol; yeast extract-based rich medium supplies the trace substance, but minimal medium must be supplemented. It is therefore important to annotate the growth medium as an experimental condition when using this term. Note that cell growth terms refer to growth under aerobic conditions unless stated otherwise.

name: decreased mating efficiency
def: "A biological process phenotype in which the observed mating efficiency is lower than normal." [PMID:15300681, PMID:16598689, PomBase:al, PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutant compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

comment: Note that in budding yeast, increased plasmid loss is often called a minichromosome maintenance defect, because "minichromosome" is roughly synonymous with an autonomously replicated and segregated plasmid in that organism. In fission yeast, a minichromosome is a large portion of a chromosome, usually about half of chromosome 3, that replicates and segregates autonomously. For smaller autonomously replicating and segregating constructs, consider 'increased plasmid loss' (FYPO:0000786).

It is an acidic compartment, containing an ensemble of acid hydrolases. At least in S. cerevisiae, there are indications that the morphology of the vacuole is variable and correlated with the cell cycle, with logarithmically growing cells having a multilobed, reticulated vacuole, while stationary phase cells contain a single large structure."

comment: Note that nuclear mRNA, Group I, Group II, and Group III introns are all spliced by a series of two transesterification reactions that occur within the RNA itself, or between two RNAs in trans splicing. Some of these require one or more proteins to stabilize the catalytic conformation, while others are autocatalytic. Note that tRNA introns are spliced by a different catalytic mechanism.

comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.

name: Golgi apparatus
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times."

def: "The process in which cells that are products of meiosis acquire the specialized features of ascospores. Ascospores are generally found in clusters of four or eight spores within a single mother cell, the ascus, and are characteristic of the ascomycete fungi (phylum Ascomycota)." [GOC:di, GOC:mah, GOC:mcc, PMID:16339736]
comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
