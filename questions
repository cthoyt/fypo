review high/levelterms, text defs, genera & differentiae

=== DONE (some to be implemented, but approach ok) ===
check whether any PATO:0000460 abnormal should instead use PATO:0001511 non-functional
	have used abnormal for 'defective' or 'defects' throughout in first pass
	* normal OK :)

---
for everything that has 'inheres_in CL:0000000 cell' - should there be a connection to PATO:0001396 ! cellular quality?
	also, would it be better|worse|no pref to use GO:0005623 'cell'?
	A: qualities inhere in things
		GG uses CL now that it's actively developed
	keep using CL, since I've started

---
this one feels silly: what to put in logical def for ones that correspond exactly to a PATO entry?
	for now, have just plunked in as 'inheres_in CL:0000000 ! cell'
	viable; lethal (sensu genetics); mononucleate; multinucleate
	A: in pombe case, always inheres in some yeast cell
		could use equivalent_to: pato ID
		but since pheno always inheres in a cell, use int_of tags & inheres_in CL:00000000

---
fypo:238
	qualifier abnormal
	inheres in cell death (GO)
	during G0 phase (GO)

---
thinking of using "normal" as a high-level term
	make sense?
	is "normal growth" is_a viable? (everything that grows normally is by definition viable)


---
how to indicate which PATO quality applies to which other term, e.g. GO or CL?
	e.g. FYPO:307 - spore germination (GO:0009847) abolished (PATO:0001508) and spores (CL:0000596) small (PATO:0000587)
	
A:
manchester owl for phenotype
phenotype (has_part some spore and has quality some small and participates_in some spore germination  and has quality some abolished
	[note - not sure all parentheses shown, or in right place]

phenotype  - bag of things

in obo, can't do all of owl syntax
can have unions or intersections
 union_of: [E][Q]
 union_of: [E][Q]

terms using existing terms
	ID:1 small spores
	ID:2 spore germination abolished
	ID:3 small spores and spore germination abolished
		intersection_of: quality
		intersection_of: has_part ID:1
		intersection_of: has_part ID:2

will usually create the "part" terms but if not ...
create anonymous classes
	id: _: small spore [anonymous class name here]
	int_of: quality
	int of: inheres_in 

then use 

=== DONE, pending further developments ===
---
what rel to use for phenotype exhibited/observed under $conditions?
	e.g. name: growth defect, slow growth at high temperatures
	the conditions can usually be expressed as PATO terms or xps using PATO, e.g.
		PATO:0001305 increased temperature;

	A: conditions are an oustanding problem that we won't solve today! 
concentration - in pato, conc inheres_in solution (e.g. blood)
and towards chemical
no meaning to "towards" rel

use this pattern - then it can be automatically converted when GG & Robert come up with better representation
		intersection_of: PATO:0001162 ! increased concentration
		intersection_of: towards CHEBI:17234 ! glucose
		intersection_of: inheres_in growth medium


this also looks relevant to this q:
how to model phenotypes where features include which parts of a process (subprocesses) do and don't occur?
	could use 'subprocess x abolished'; what about capturing 'subprocess y happens'?
	e.g. Jacky's various spore germination phenotypes - some get further than others
	A: see above - try to model same way

---
which PATO terms to use for increased/decreased catalytic activity?
	PATO:0001414 catalytic activity
	increased rate? increased occurrence?
	A: use inc|dec rate terms for now, for consistency with GG work; probably ok
	but also see note/M action item re: SGD annotations

---
is the population-phenotype approach to 'long low pen' etc. ok?
	cell population phenotype that [description]
	includes_cells_with_phenotype FYPO:nnn [some cell phenotype]
		cf. has_part some vs has_part only
		this plays nice with OWL
	A: keep going, because (once again) anything consistent can be converted if necessary
	note 2011-06-01: could just change to has_part; I wouldn't mind. but will change later ...

=== OUTSTANDING ===

analogous question - what to do about vegetative growth etc.?
	A: request 'vegetative growth' in GO (then if that fails we'll revisit)

need differentiae for 'sensitive to $stress' terms
	e.g. ontology terms for radiation (UV, ionizing radiation, etc)
	A: also connected with the Conditions Issue, plus additional need-ontology crunchiness
	update 2011-05: most of these now use 'response to' process terms, so can punt


need to clarify definitions and distinctions between some shape terms
	bulbous (is_a spheroid) vs. teardrop-shaped (not under spheroid)
	clavate & obclavate are concave -- is that the only distinction 
	which to use for "bottle-shaped" pombe cells? (narrow bit tapers to smaller than wt diameter? confirm with Jacky)
	which for "pear-shaped"? (narrower bit is wt diameter? confirm J)
	A: GG says PATO shape terms need work anyway
		try to arrange meeting with [find out who] in Rafael's group to hash out shape terms - mathematical defs?


inspired by previous: what to do about totally abnormal process?
	don't belong in GO or PATO
	A for now: try to define in terms of GO process(es)
	example 2011-05-12: used GO:0018158 (protein oxidation) for FYPO:0000219 xp, because carbonylation is abnormal

population phenotypes
	need to find or create a term for 'colony'; maybe also others (liq culture?)
	ENVO has 'cell culture' but it's is_a tissue culture
	might be something useful in BTO ... ask them for 'colony'?
		they also have some culture condition terms

what to do for viability-requires-process x terms (e.g. fypo:275)?
	note: text def needs work - how is it different from normal checkpoint functioning?
		e.g. does the checkpoint have to stop cycle?
  note may 5:
	spindle checkpoint activated' = progression through anaphase delayed, req spindle checkpoint genes (delay abolished in double mutant)
		viable in rqh1
	'spindle checkpoint required' = anaphase delay as in 'sp ch activated', plus cells die if checkpoint genes also mutated
		alp5, pfs2
		actually = lethal chromosome segregation in double mutant with mad2
	so what you see is that the checkpoint is causing a delay in anaphase; further investigation (i.e. double mutant) shows that cells may survive or die if the checkpoint isn't there, depending on the gene/allele

yeast phenotypes (SGD using APO) - looks like a lot of their 'decreased x' are actually 'decreased occurrence of process x', so dubious about the APO:0000003 xp using PATO:0001997
	analogous q for increased APO:0000004/PATO:00004710
	discussion: how are they using 'decreased [occurrence]' vs. 'decreased rate' vs. 'decreased duration'? may have to update xps
	also check FYPO xps!
	update 2011-05: my tentative take on these
		occurrence - number of times a process is started, and assumes it's finished every time it starts; also thinking about whether occurrence or rate is better fit for throughput/flux
		rate - how fast a process goes once it's started
		duration - how long a process takes from start to finish

always ok to use 'response to' GO terms for 'resistance' phenotypes? (ask both George and Val)
	A: probably fine; make sure it makes sense to Val, lab people, etc. (and if not, get specific reasons & define what else they mean)
	update: done.


what to do about "problem" terms from old CV (i.e. ones for which xp isn't obvious)?
	include pending xp def? may have to obsolete some later
	but other alternative is not having some available for curation tool launch (depending on timing)
		have included terms without xp defs for now, so existing annotations can at least point to FYPO IDs
	this is really a header for a series of specific questions
	update: filling in specific questions below


=== Additional things to do ===
From MAH/GG meeting 2011-05-03

1.
look at 'sensitivity|resistance of process' 
inheres in process (cell growth)
towards chemical
(another one where we fix all at once if pattern consistent)
ACTION ITEM (M) - done

2.
set up to do owl conversion & reasoning
	after beerfest - install on themonster?

3.
organize mtg on shapes
	update: 1st meeting held 2011-06-09

4.
G & R will try incorporating into phenotype network


m - follow up on response to & sensitivity/resistance [done May 2011]
m - look into occurrence vs rate [1st pass may 2011]

=============
updates

2011-05-12: have added this, but it still looks incomplete - need connection to cell growth
	see conditions, concentration, & has_part xps above
[Term]
id: FYPO:0000286
name: sensitive to manganese depletion
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A cellular process phenotype in which cells grow poorly in medium that has a low concentration of manganese (Mn2+)." [PMID:14723709, PomBase:mah]
comment: use CHEBI:29035 in cross-product
is_a: FYPO:0000045 ! abnormal cell growth
intersection_of: PATO:0001163 ! decreased concentration
intersection_of: towards CHEBI:29035
intersection_of: inheres_in BTO:0000316 ! culture medium

2011-05-12: new question
which PATO term(s) to use for "accumulation" in the sense both yeasts are using it? i.e. 
	maybe higher concentration? but not necessarily in a solution
	not sure 'has extra parts of type' or 'present in greater numbers in organism' quite fits either

example term:
[Term]
id: FYPO:0000220
name: accumulation of non-coding outer repeat transcripts
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A cellular metabolism phenotype in which small interfering RNA transcripts derived from the centromere outer repeat region are present at greater levels than normal." [PomBase:mah, PMID:20211136]
is_a: FYPO:0000140 ! cellular metabolism phenotype
created_by: midori
creation_date: 2011-04-19T02:59:38Z

for this one, will also need to link to something for the transcript or where it comes from ... maybe
	GO:0034507 chromosome, centromeric outer repeat region
	SO:0000577 centromere
	SO:0000646 siRNA [descendant of transcript]
	SO:0000657 repeat_region - or new descendant for centromere outer repeat?

another example (added 2011-06-15):
id: FYPO:0000255
name: localization defects, nuclear accumulation of Pap1 and Sty1
def: "" [PomBase:mah, PMID:12896976]
is_a: FYPO:0000138 ! localization phenotype

presumably will need PRO IDs for Pap 1 and Sty1
---

2011-05-16:
need way to model changes in gene expression - capture targets that correspond to GO annotation extensions

example:

[Term]
id: FYPO:0000239
name: expression of MBF target genes increased
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A gene expression phenotype in which transcription of genes that are regulated by MBF (the MluI cell cycle box factor) is increased." [PomBase:mah]
is_a: FYPO:0000142 ! gene expression phenotype

probably want xp to involve GO:0071931 positive regulation of transcription involved in G1/S phase of mitotic cell cycle, or maybe parent GO:0000083 regulation of ...
---

2011-06-03:
- I've now added some results_in_formation_of links between 'abnormal [structure] assembly' terms and 'abnormal [structure]' terms
 	e.g. abnormal spindle assembly results_in_formation_of FYPO:0000119 abnormal spindle FYPO:0000120
	Is this a good approach?

- What relation to use between 'abnormal mitotic spindle elongation' and 'abnormal mitotic spindle'? seems there should be some link, but neither is_a nor results_in_formation_of seems to fit. (At the moment it's just is_a abnormal mitosis.)


2011-06-13:
- have text def for 'mutator', but need XP. as stopgap, have used SO 'sequence_alteration', but that's a continuant (I think), and 'increased occurrence' really wants an occurrent

[Term]
id: FYPO:0000256
name: mutator
namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
def: "A cell phenotype in which mutations occur at a higher rate than normal." [PomBase:mah]
is_a: FYPO:0000002 ! cell phenotype
intersection_of: PATO:0002051
intersection_of: inheres_in SO:0001059

cf. worm phenotype - no xp def in http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/obo/obo/ontology/phenotype/worm_phenotype_xp.obo
	id: WBPhenotype:0000228
	name: spontaneous mutation rate increased


- have added terms for haploinsufficient and haplosufficient (syn: haploproficient)
	is a phenotype ontology the right place for these?
	also, even if they do fit, I have no idea how to do xps for them

- trying to adapt the 'conditions' pattern to various pombe situations
	starting recommendation (also above), for concentration change
		intersection_of: PATO:0001162 ! increased concentration
		intersection_of: towards CHEBI:17234 ! glucose
		intersection_of: inheres_in growth medium (using BTO:0000316 'culture medium')

	case: different nitrogen sources
		intersection_of: PATO:0000467 ! present
		intersection_of: towards CHEBI:17203 ! L-proline
		intersection_of: inheres_in growth medium (using BTO:0000316)

		intersection_of: PATO:0000467 ! present
		intersection_of: towards CHEBI:16134 ! ammonia
		intersection_of: inheres_in growth medium (using BTO:0000316)

	do these look sensible?


2011-06-14:
- how to do xps for population loss of viability terms?
	which PATO term(s)? 
	what terms in differentiae? e.g.
	 	id: FYPO:0000244
		name: growth defect, required during nutrient depletion
		use GO:0009267 ! cellular response to starvation?

		id: FYPO:0000245
		name: growth defect, required for stationary phase
		use GO:0060274 ! maintenance of stationary phase? or GO:0070314 ! G1 to G0 transition (related synonym "stationary phase")?

- is there a quality for requirement, other than auxotrophy?
	and review fypo:246 xp - any good?

2011-06-15:
- need xp for FYPO:0000252 increased spontaneous diploidization
	def: A cell phenotype in which heterothallic haploid cells spontaneously form cells with diploid DNA content at a higher frequency than normal.
	not sure whether there's a GO term that corresponds
	(may be moot if we decide the diploidization is downstream of the other cell div defects)

- added fypo:255 to question about 'accumulation' above
	id: FYPO:0000255
	name: nuclear accumulation of Pap1 and Sty1
	namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
	def: "A localization phenotype in which the proteins Pap1 and Sty1 accumulate, and are constitutively located in, the nucleus." [PMID:12896976, PomBase:mah]
	synonym: "localization defects, nuclear accumulation of Pap1 and Sty1" EXACT [PomBase:mah]

2011-06-16
- a couple more perplexing ones (i.e. how to do xp?)

	id: FYPO:0000278
	name: slow cell growth upon spore germination
	namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
	def: "A cellular process phenotype in which cells grow slowly following spore germination, resulting in the formation of a smaller colony than normal in a given amount of time." [PomBase:mah]
	synonym: "spores produced smaller colonies" RELATED [PomBase:mah]
	is_a: FYPO:0000046 ! slow cell growth
	is_a: FYPO:0000305 ! abnormal spore germination

	id: FYPO:0000279
	name: formation of azygotic asci upon sporulation
	namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
	def: "A sporulation phenotype in which azygotic asci form following conjugation and subsequent sporulation." [PMID:16169489, PMID:18780734, PMID:20404563, PomBase:mah]
	synonym: "sporulation defects, azygotic asci" EXACT [PomBase:mah]
	is_a: FYPO:0000121 ! abnormal sporulation

- I'm also unsure about this xp:
	[Term]
	id: FYPO:0000238
	name: inviable upon G0 to G1 transition
	namespace: fission_yeast_phenotype
	def: "A cell phenotype in which cells fail to resume growth after several days in G0 phase. The inviable cells show some features characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of DNA." [PMID:19197239, PomBase:mah]
	synonym: "die in G0 with an apoptotic-like phenotype" EXACT [PomBase:mah]
