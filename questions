review high/levelterms, text defs, genera & differentiae

===DONE===
check whether any PATO:0000460 abnormal should instead use PATO:0001511 non-functional
	have used abnormal for 'defective' or 'defects' throughout in first pass
	* normal OK :)

=== OUSTANDING ===
what rel to use for phenotype exhibited/observed under $conditions?
	e.g. name: growth defect, slow growth at high temperatures
	the conditions can usually be expressed as PATO terms or xps using PATO, e.g.
		PATO:0001305 increased temperature;

		intersection of: PATO:0001162 ! increased concentration
		intersection of: inheres_in CHEBI:17234 ! glucose

	analogous question - what to do about vegetative growth etc.?

for everything that has 'inheres_in CL:0000000 cell' - should there be a connection to PATO:0001396 ! cellular quality?
	also, would it be better|worse|no pref to use GO:0005623 'cell'?

which PATO terms to use for increased/decreased catalytic activity?
	PATO:0001414 catalytic activity
	increased rate? increased occurrence?

this one feels silly: what to put in logical def for ones that correspond exactly to a PATO entry?
	for now, have just plunked in as 'inheres_in CL:0000000 ! cell'
	viable; lethal (sensu genetics); mononucleate; multinucleate

need differentiae for 'sensitive to $stress' terms
	e.g. ontology terms for radiation (UV, ionizing radiation, etc)

need to clarify definitions and distinctions between some shape terms
	bulbous (is_a spheroid) vs. teardrop-shaped (not under spheroid)
	clavate & obclavate are concave -- is that the only distinction 
	which to use for "bottle-shaped" pombe cells? (narrow bit tapers to smaller than wt diameter? confirm with Jacky)
	which for "pear-shaped"? (narrower bit is wt diameter? confirm J)

what to do about "problem" terms from old CV (i.e. ones for which xp isn't obvious)?
	include pending xp def? may have to obsolete some later
	but other alternative is not having some available for curation tool launch (depending on timing)

thinking of using "normal" as a high-level term
	make sense?
	is "normal growth" is_a viable? (everything that grows normally is by definition viable)

is the population-phenotype approach to 'long low pen' etc. ok?
	cell population phenotype that [description]
	includes_cells_with_phenotype FYPO:nnn [some cell phenotype]

what to do for viability-requires-process x terms (e.g. fypo:275)?
