review high/levelterms, text defs, genera & differentiae

check whether any PATO:0000460 abnormal should instead use PATO:0001511 non-functional
	have used abnormal for 'defective' or 'defects' throughout in first pass

what rel to use for phenotype exhibited/observed under $conditions?
	e.g. name: growth defect, slow growth at high temperatures
	the conditions can usually be expressed as PATO terms or xps using PATO, e.g.
		PATO:0001305 increased temperature;

		intersection of: PATO:0001162 ! increased concentration
		intersection of: inheres_in CHEBI:17234 ! glucose

for everything that has 'inheres_in CL:0000000 cell' - should there be a connection to PATO:0001396 ! cellular quality?

which PATO terms to use for increased/decreased catalytic activity?
	PATO:0001414 catalytic activity
	increased rate? increased occurrence?

this one feels silly: what to put in logical def for ones that correspond exactly to a PATO entry?
	for now, have just plunked in as 'inheres_in CL:0000000 ! cell'
	viable; lethal (sensu genetics); mononucleate; multinucleate

ontology terms for radiation (UV, ionizing r, etc)

need to clarify definitions and distinctions between some shape terms
	bulbous (is_a spheroid) vs. teardrop-shaped (not under spheroid)
	clavate & obclavate are concave -- is that the only distinction 
	which to use for "bottle-shaped" pombe cells? (narrow bit tapers to smaller than wt diameter? confirm with Jacky)
	which for "pear-shaped"? (narrower bit is wt diameter? confirm J)
