comment: This relation is not constrained with respect to whether C completely surrounds, or is adjacent to, the location where P is executed. Example: chromatin silencing at centromere unfolds_around centromere : Repression of transcription of centromeric DNA by the formation of heterochromatin.

name: has_penetrance
def: "Relation between a phenotype and its observed penetrance in a population. Penetrance is the proportion of individuals carrying an allele that express a trait associated with the allele." [PomBase:mah]

id: has_expressivity
name: has_expressivity
def: "Relation between a phenotype and its observed expressivity in a cell. Expressivity is the extent to which a phenotype is expressed in an individual." [PomBase:mah]
synonym: "expressivity" EXACT [PomBase:mah]
comment: Expressivity is relevant in individuals in which a phenotype is penetrant, i.e. that have an allele and express the phenotype associated with the allele.
