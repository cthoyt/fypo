1. Terms in BioGRID

BioGrid: Physical Interactions	APO:0000187	ECO:0000021 ! physical interaction

BioGrid: Affinity Capture-Luminescence	APO:0000318	ECO: [see notes]
An interaction is inferred when a bait protein, tagged with luciferase, is enzymatically detected in immunoprecipitates of the prey protein as light emission. The prey protein is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000070 ! co-immunoprecipitation experiment

BioGrid: Affinity Capture-MS	APO:0000162	ECO: [see notes]
An interaction is inferred when a “bait” protein is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag and the associated interaction partner is identified by mass spectrometric methods.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000070 ! co-immunoprecipitation experiment
	also request new subtype of ECO:0000021 ! physical interaction, for mass spectrometry assay

BioGrid: Affinity Capture-RNA	APO:0000163	ECO: [see notes]
An interaction is inferred when a bait protein is affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag and associated RNA species identified by Northern blot, RT-PCR, affinity labeling, sequencing, or microarray analysis.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000070 ! co-immunoprecipitation experiment

BioGrid: Affinity Capture-Western	APO:0000165	ECO: [see notes]
An interaction is inferred when a Bait protein affinity captured from cell extracts by either polyclonal antibody or epitope tag and the associated interaction partner identified by Western blot with a specific polyclonal antibody or second epitope tag. This category is also used if an interacting protein is visualized directly by dye stain or radioactivity. Note that this differs from any co-purification experiment involving affinity capture in that the co-purification experiment involves at least one extra purification step to get rid of potential contaminating proteins.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000070 ! co-immunoprecipitation experiment
	also link to ECO:0000112 ! Western blot assay

BioGrid: Biochemical Activity	APO:0000166	ECO:0000005 ! enzyme assay data
An interaction is inferred from the biochemical effect of one protein upon another, for example, GTP-GDP exchange activity or phosphorylation of a substrate by a kinase. The “bait” protein executes the activity on the substrate “hit” protein. A Modification value is recorded for interactions of this type with the possible values Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, Sumoylation, Dephosphorylation, Methylation, Prenylation, Acetylation, Deubiquitination, Proteolytic Processing, Glucosylation, Nedd(Rub1)ylation, Deacetylation, No Modification, Demethylation.

BioGrid: Co-crystal Structure	APO:0000167	ECO: [see notes]
Interaction directly demonstrated at the atomic level by X-ray crystallography. Also used for NMR or Electron Microscopy (EM) structures. If a structure is demonstrated between 3 or more proteins, one is chosen as the bait and binary interactions are recorded between that protein and the others.

BioGrid: Co-fractionation	APO:0000168	ECO:0000102 ! co-fractionation data
Interaction inferred from the presence of two or more protein subunits in a partially purified protein preparation. If co-fractionation is demonstrated between 3 or more proteins, one is chosen as the bait and binary interactions are recorded between that protein and the others.

BioGrid: Co-localization	APO:0000169	ECO: [see notes]
An interaction is inferred from co-localization of two proteins in the cell, including co-dependent association of proteins with promoter DNA in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000122 ! protein localization experiment

BioGrid: Co-purification	APO:0000170	ECO:0000022 ! co-purification experiment

	request new term, perhaps subtype of ECO:0000002 ! direct assay result

BioGrid: PCA	APO:0000244	ECO: [see notes]
A Protein-Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) is a protein-protein interaction assay in which a bait protein is expressed as fusion to one of the either N- or C- terminal peptide fragments of a reporter protein and prey protein is expressed as fusion to the complementary N- or C- terminal fragment of the same reporter protein. Interaction of bait and prey proteins bring together complementary fragments, which can then fold into an active reporter, e.g. the split-ubiquitin assay.
	request new subtype of ECO:0000025 ! hybrid interaction experiment

BioGrid: Protein-peptide	APO:0000180	ECO: [see notes]

	request new subtype of ECO:0000136 ! nucleic acid binding assay
	existing ECO:0000146 ! Northwestern analysis would be a child of the new term; I think ECO:0000138 ! ribohomopolymer binding assay would be as well

An interaction is detected between purified proteins in vitro.
	request new subtype ECO:0000003 ! reconstitution assay

Bait protein expressed as a DNA binding domain (DBD) fusion and prey expressed as a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) fusion and interaction measured by reporter gene activation.
	are two-hybrid experiments always done in yeast? if so, ECO:0000068 ! yeast 2-hybrid assay is fine and a synonym would be nice
