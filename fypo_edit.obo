comment: Note that this term is temporary and will eventually be made obsolete, because a "mixed population" observation would be better represented as two or more separate phenotype annotations, each with penetrance specified. This term is maintained as a stopgap until querying of annotations with extensions that represent penetrance, and combinations thereof, improves.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. There may be enough evidence to support annotation to a more specific term such as 'abnormal transcriptional response to pheromone' (FYPO:0000984); if not, it is safer to annotate to 'increased transcription' (FYPO:0000780) or 'decreased transcription' (FYPO:0000781) rather than explicitly claiming that an effect on regulation was observed.

It is therefore important to annotate the growth medium as an experimental condition when using this term.

def: "A biological process phenotype in which the observed mating efficiency is lower than normal." [PMID:15300681, PMID:16598689, PomBase:al, PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

def: "A cellular process phenotype observed in the vegetative growth phase of the life cycle in which the occurrence of cellular pigment accumulation is increased." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that normal cells do not accumulate detectable levels of any pigment; for this reason, FYPO does not include separate terms for 'increased' and 'abnormal' pigment accumulation. Also note that pigment accumulates in the vacuole. This term refers to GO:0033059 'cellular pigmentation', rather than GO:0043482 'cellular pigment accumulation', because GO:0043482 has paths to 'response to stimulus' in GO.

In some dumbbell-shaped cells, the diameter at the ends is much greater than in wild-type cells." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that all dumbbell-shaped cells observed are also elongated. The distinction between this phenotype and swollen elongated cells (FYPO:0001429) is that dumbbell-shaped cells have a constriction along the long axis, whereas swollen elongated cells do not. Note that if you have done an experiment that assays the viability of a population of cells, such as looking at colony growth or growth in liquid culture, you should also annotate to 'inviable cell population' (FYPO:0002059) or one of its descendants.

comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutant compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

Note that if you have done an experiment that assays the viability of a population of cells, such as looking at colony growth or growth in liquid culture, you should also annotate to 'inviable cell population' (FYPO:0002059) or one of its descendants.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

def: "A cell phenotype in which a protein does not localize to, and is therefore absent from, a place where it is normally found." [PomBase:mah]
comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. If this term is used, we recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay.

def: "A cell phenotype in which minichromosomes are lost at a higher frequency than normal. Minichromosome loss occurs when one or both daughter cells do not inherit copies of a minichromosome from the mother cell, and may result from failure of minichromosome replication or segregation." [PomBase:mah]
comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. Note that in budding yeast, increased plasmid loss is often called a minichromosome maintenance defect, because "minichromosome" is roughly synonymous with an autonomously replicated and segregated plasmid in that organism. In fission yeast, a minichromosome is a large portion of a chromosome, usually about half of chromosome 3, that replicates and segregates autonomously. For smaller autonomously replicating and segregating constructs, consider 'increased plasmid loss' (FYPO:0000786).

comment: Note that normal cells do not accumulate detectable levels of any pigment; for this reason, FYPO does not include separate terms for 'increased' and 'abnormal' pigment accumulation. Also note that pigment accumulates in the vacuole. This term refers to GO:0033059 'cellular pigmentation', rather than GO:0043482 'cellular pigment accumulation', because GO:0043482 has paths to 'response to stimulus' in GO.

name: inviable mixed population including germinated spores and bottle-shaped cells
def: "A mixed population phenotype in which all cells in a population are inviable, and the population includes a mixture of germinated spores and bottle-shaped vegetative cells. The bottle-shaped cells arise from division of some of the germinated spores, and may form a microcolony of up to 64 cells." [PomBase:mah, PomBase:vw]
comment: Note that this term is temporary and will eventually be made obsolete, because a "mixed population" observation would be better represented as two or more separate phenotype annotations, each with penetrance specified. This term is maintained as a stopgap until querying of annotations with extensions that represent penetrance, and combinations thereof, improves.

This term is maintained as a stopgap until querying of annotations with extensions that represent penetrance, and combinations thereof, improves.

def: "A mixed population phenotype in which all cells in a population are inviable germinated spores, and in which some cells divide once and others do not divide. In the cells that divide once, an inviable cell forms from the growing end of the germ tube, but does not divide further." [PomBase:mah, PomBase:vw]
comment: Note that this term is temporary and will eventually be made obsolete, because a "mixed population" observation would be better represented as two or more separate phenotype annotations, each with penetrance specified. This term is maintained as a stopgap until querying of annotations with extensions that represent penetrance, and combinations thereof, improves.
