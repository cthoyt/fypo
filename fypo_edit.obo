comment: Note that this term should be used only for cell cycle arrest that occurs in mutants but not in wild type cells. For phenotypes affecting cell cycle that normally occurs, e.g. in response to mating pheromone, see 'normally arrested cell cycle progression' (FYPO:0001025), 'abnormal occurrence of normal cell cycle arrest' (FYPO:0001026), and their child terms.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will seldom be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. There may be enough evidence to support annotation to a more specific term such as 'abnormal transcriptional response to pheromone' (FYPO:0000984); if not, it is safer to annotate to 'increased transcription' (FYPO:0000780) or 'decreased transcription' (FYPO:0000781) rather than explicitly claiming that an effect on regulation was observed.

comment: Note that trace amounts of another carbon source are usually required for S. pombe growth on glycerol; yeast extract-based rich medium supplies the trace substance, but minimal medium must be supplemented. It is therefore important to annotate the growth medium as an experimental condition when using this term. Note that cell growth terms refer to growth under aerobic conditions unless stated otherwise.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

def: "A cell phenotype in which a protein is observed in a particular location where it is not normally found." [PomBase:mah]
comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutant compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both. For this reason, this term is not a child of 'mating phenotype' (FYPO:0000031).

Plant lectins such as HHA, GNA, NPA, or Concanavalin A (ConA) decrease but do not abolish S. pombe-E. coli coflocculation.

Note that with growth on plates, growth rate can be difficult to assess, so it may be better to use 'decreased cell growth' (FYPO:0000046).
